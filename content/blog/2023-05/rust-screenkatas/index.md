Recently I've published a few screencasts solving programming challenge katas with Codurance (part of the screenkatas series) in Rust. The first is a basic introduction, installing Rust and writing a basic FizzBuzz. The next two are parts of a two-parter which is a bit more complex, solving the N-Queens problem with TDD. I also take time to explain the theory behind search problems and the N-Queen problem in particular using diagrams.

If the jump in complexity from FizzBuzz to N-Queens is a bit dizzying, my colleague Jocelyn also published this great screencast on solving the Mars Rover kata with Rust:
