After a while of attending the [London Software Craftsmanship Community](https://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/) and running events there I noticed that quite a few people didn't really understand Test Driven Development (TDD), a practice I and my coworkers use to develop software every day. So I arranged an event in which I explained the fundamentals of TDD and my colleague Ignacio Gonzalez gave a demonstration, then got the attendees working on some problems and practicing TDD. It was well received and afterwards several people suggested we record it as a video/screencast to share online. So, we did! Check it out:
