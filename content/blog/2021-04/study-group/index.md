Hoping to broaden my programming horizons in 2020 I studied F#, but I didn't make as much progress as I'd hoped. My objective in 2021 is to pick up Rust, and I wanted to try something different this time. Thinking back to a study group I'd been part of in the past, and to group projects and such in my student days, I saw the following advantages:

* Goals and deadlines - a group has to move to some cadence that is agreed up-front by all involved. Something like "Let's read a chapter every week". This gives you a specific, measureable goal and a timeframe to complete it in.
* Motivation - I find that it is easy to put off something if you're doing it for yourself, but if your friends and colleagues and relying on you you have all the more reason to get it done.
* Feedback - once you've read and practiced some particular aspect of what you're trying to learn, how do you know you've understood it correctly? In a group setting you can share your understanding with one another and get feedback on whether you've understood the material correctly.
* Fun - it is much more fun to learn along with friends and colleagues than to slog away by yourself.

So, based on that I started a study group in January. We meet every other week, regularly get 5-7 people in attendance, read [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and have fun while we're at it. It has been great- I feel I've easily learned as much about Rust after 3 months as I did about F# in all of 2020. So if you have something you want to learn- any kind of skill or knowledge- I suggest looking for others who are interested in it too, from your workplace and among your friends, and studying together.

## How

Okay that's the "why", here's the "how". First thing is to create a channel or group chat (in Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, or whatever). Then drop some messages about what you want to study and the name of the channel into several prominent, related channels- don't be shy, make sure as many see it as possible. In my case I dropped my message in several of the most populated channels but still had people only finding out about it and joining a month after we'd started. It is important to create your channel first, because it gives anyone that's interested a place to register their interest and host discussions- otherwise you have several different, disjointed discussions in different channels. Of course, you want to big it up in meetings and watercooler chats with friends and colleagues too.

Then I'd suggest you invite anyone that showed an interest, give it a little time to see who joins, and start openly discussing how this group might work. With my group I made it clear from the start that I didn't intend to dictate how this would work. I think that helped to get people engaged and invested in the group. I did this by asking for input from the group on every decision and taking votes (posting the options and voting with emoji reacts works well). There are a bunch of things you should decide together:

* How often will we meet? I found every other week works well
* What day & time will we meet? It should be a time that works for as many people as possible, but at the same time you can't please everyone.
* What will we study? There are probably numerous resources on your subject, and you need to agree on one shared goal.
* What will the format be?

### Format

That last one, the format, is important. You should agree on the format between yourselves and even iterate on it as need be in the future, but let me offer the template we've settled on as a template. I'm not sure of the exact origin of this format, but it's based on something my colleague [Alfredo](https://twitter.com/alfredodev) suggested in a previous study group. At each meeting we:

* Do introductions/chatting
* For each section of reading we've completed since the last meeting...
  * Someone presents that section of the material
  * This can take any form- a slides, a live coding demo, a conversation. It's worth discussing with your group which presentation styles work for them and keep that in mind, but there's no need to be prescriptive.
  * Everyone should feel free to interrupt and discuss. The idea is for the presenter to put their understanding of the material up for scrutiny. The ensuing discussion challenges any misunderstandings that we may have unwittingly picked up and ensures everyone has the same shared understanding.
* Discuss any exercises we've completed since the last meeting- what was challenging or confusing, how did you find it?
  * In our case we use the [Rustlings code exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) and [Exercism Rust  track](https://exercism.io/tracks/rust) to practice between meetings. Each of the Rustling exercises are mapped to chapters in the book so we can ensure they're relevant to what we're reading.
* Decide how much of the material we'll commit to reading before the next meeting
  * The word "commit" here is key- this is something you're all committing to completing within a timeframe, so don't be overambitious. Ensure it is something that everyone is comfortable with.
  * We look up the page numbers of the next few chapters so that we know how long they are, then compare that to how many pages we got through in previous iterations.
  * If, based on the previous exercise, we don't think we can complete the next whole chapter then we'll split it into smaller sections.
  * Estimating and splitting work, informing planning by how much we completed in previous "sprints" - you may notice that this is similar to how agile estimations and planning work ðŸ˜‰ I suppose the same principles of planning apply everywhere
* Decide which exercises we'll commit to completing before the next meeting
  * As above, with exercises (in our case, coding challenges. But it could be sheet music to play, or foreign language books to read, or whatever).
  * Ideally these should be relevant to the material. In our case this was easy because the Rustling exercises map to the chapters in the book.
* Ask for volunteers to present at the next meeting
  * They will prepare a presentation of some sort to share their notes and thoughts on some section of the material for the next meeting.
  * These make up the presentations from the start of the format.
